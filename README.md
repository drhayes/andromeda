Project Andromeda
=================

I want to build a spaceship console for my son; lots of switches, knobs, and
blinking lights. The only part of this I'm confident about is that I can code
things, so I'll be documenting the project step-by-excrutiating-step somewhere.
Probably on [drhayes.io][] somewhere.

Components
----------

  * A [tessel][].
  * Lots of switches, LEDs, and sliders from [Adafruit][] and [SparkFun][].
  * More soldering knowledge than I currently possess.
  * More physical building skill than I currently possess.

Code
----

Since the [tessel][] is JS-programmable I'll be storing the code for the board
here in the `src` directory. Until it's finalized what the board is going to
do I'll store my prototype code in the `src/proto` directory. There will be
lots of documentation for my own sake.
